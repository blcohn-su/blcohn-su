            <p><b>About me...</b></p>
            <p><br/>My name is Bari Cohn and I am from Los Angeles, California. I am majoring in public relations in the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Relations and information management and technology.
            I hope to pursue a career in entertainment publicity, using the skills I've learned in the iSchool to help me stay current with emerging technologies and applying them to the communications field.
            I love listening to music and hanging out with friends. My favorite food is sushi and my favorite color is purple. My favorite movie is <i>The Devil Wears Prada.</i>  </p>
